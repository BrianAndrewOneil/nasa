## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

I built this web app to be easy-to-use, fun, and delightful for users. It features an integration with NASA's API for their "pic of the day" and includes a detailed description of the celestial element displayed on the screen. Users can review the current day's pic as well as any past day's pic that they choose through a simple date-picker application.

## Optimizations
Future enhancements for this app include better testing for optimized responsive design for devices with different screen sizes. Currently the app is optimized for desktop display and smartphone display.

## Lessons Learned
Integrating an API into user interaction with the app.
